# Dutch House Market


### Welcome to the analysis of the Dutch housing market, where we will dive into the trends, patterns, and correlations that exist within this market. Using a dataset obtained from Kaggle, we have carefully cleaned and processed the data to extract the most valuable information.

### In this analysis, I will explore a range of topics, including current price trends, the evolution of price per square meter over the years of build, and changes in prices for houses built in the last 50 years. 

### I will also examine the energy labels of houses, identify patterns in the types of houses that buyers are looking for, and analyze how the location of a house impacts its price. Additionally, I will use statistical analysis to identify any significant differences in the factors that influence house prices in the Netherlands.
